It’s beautiful how the most unexpected stories turn into the most unforgettable ones.

From being complete strangers in our first year — barely acknowledging each other’s presence — to now being each other’s safest place... what a journey it’s been.

What followed was something I never saw coming — the late-night talks, the random teasing, the effortless laughter, the way we became each other’s comfort zone without even realizing it. Somewhere between the banter and the deep conversations, you became someone I didn’t want to go a day without.

We had seen a full roller coaster ride — some days we were closer than ever, and some days, it felt like we were drifting apart.

But in all that back and forth, one thing stayed with me — you.

Even when we weren’t talking, I would think about you. I would wonder what you were doing, if you were okay. I missed your presence more than I could ever admit.

And then one day, you said: “I’m here for you. I’ll wait however long you need. I’m not going anywhere.”

I don’t think you realize what those words did to me. That one sentence made me feel seen, safe... and truly loved.

And I thought — if you could be so sure about me, so kind, so consistent, why couldn’t I just take a leap too?

From that moment on, something shifted. We started going on sweet little dates, sharing more of our hearts — and on 20th April, we happened. Not by accident, not by force, but with love — soft, patient, and real.

You’ve become my peace in chaos, my biggest cheerleader, the one who understands even the things I don’t say aloud. You make me feel cared for, protected, and so deeply loved.

All I want now is to be that person for you too — in every joy, every storm, every quiet moment. I want to be there when you smile, when you cry, when you dream, and even when you doubt.

I don’t know what life has planned for us — but I know what I want:

To cherish every tiny moment with you.
To grow, love, and laugh together.
To keep choosing you, every single day.

Thank you for being exactly who you are.
Thank you for loving me the way you do.
I love you more than words will ever be able to say — now, and always. 💗
